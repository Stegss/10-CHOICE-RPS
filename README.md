## **12 Choice Rock Paper Scissors**
by Joseph and Gabe

## Game Description

This game is an expanded version of the classic game rock paper scicsors, but instead of the simple 3 choices the two players get to choose from a list of twelve unique items. This included the classic rock, paper, scissor, and the new water, air, fire, earth, grass, arbenium, evil, beckiniun, and tominium. Each choice has it's own set of conditions that determine which player wins or if it is a tie. This makes the game more strategic and fun for the players to learn and adapt the longer they play the game. Each player takes turns turns making their choices, and the first to reach 10 points wins the entire game.

## Technical Stuff

- **Programming Language:**
  - Python
  
- **Libraries Used:**
  - os (for clearing the console between turns)
  - time (for pacing the gameplay and readability)
 
- **Game Logic:**

  - Uses dictionaries to define items/choices, emojis, and win conditions.
  - Implements functions for input validation, winner determination, and tracking the score.

## Personal Goals

- **Strengthen Fundamentals:** We practiced with functions, loops, and user input handling.
- **Organization:** We learned how to structure larger game logic cleanly using dictionaries and functions.
- **Balancing:** We learned how to deal with balancing a game to ensure the players' enjoyment.
- **Challenge:** We were most challenged with taking an old game and changing it while still keeping it true to the original without making it boring.

## Tutorial

1. Run the script in Python.
2. Two players take turns selecting their choice from the list.
3. The game will display round results and keep track of scores.
4. The first player to reach 10 points wins the game.
5. Type `quit` to exit the game if you please.
